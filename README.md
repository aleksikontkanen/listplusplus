This is a work-in-progress [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/docs/) project.

## How to use this app

*This app does not work on its own*. It will need a backend system which is not published yet (but under development) or a local/offline support.

### How to boot this up:

- clone the repo
- cd to the project folder

```bash
$ sudo npm install -g ionic cordova
$ npm install
$ ionic serve
```
